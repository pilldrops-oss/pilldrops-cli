// The platform tools beyond the create/run/destroy core: captures

// secrets, raw port forwards and custom domains. Split from mcp.go for size
// only — toolList appends them, and they use its helpers and its failure shape.
//
// COPIED, deliberately, from the platform's internal/mcp/platformtools.go, which
// is where these definitions are maintained. The two servers exist because the
// two transports do: stdio can only be spawned by the CLI, the /mcp HTTP mount
// can only live in the platform. Everything above the Backend is the same code,
// and a shared module across two repos with separate release cycles costs more
// than re-copying ~450 lines of declarative tool definitions. When a tool
// changes there, copy the file again rather than editing this one.
//
// tools.json in this directory is the same copy's machine-checkable half: every
// tool name and input schema on both sides, regenerated on the platform and
// copied here with this file. TestToolManifestMatchesCatalog fails in whichever
// repo drifts from it, naming the tool and the side — which is how `verify` and
// `verify_status` managed to live here for months after the platform deleted
// them and the route they called.
